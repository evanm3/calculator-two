Second attempt at theodinproject.com 's calculator project.
After using so many resources and cobbling together a working calculator
    I found I didn't understand how it worked. So this is a fresh start
    with the intent of knowing it thoroughly enough I could explain and 
    possibly teach another how a calculator is made.
I intend to model this after a BRAUN brand calculator so some buttons might
    not have functionality but I will make an attempt. (M+, M-, MR, etc)
