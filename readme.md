Second attempt at theodinproject.com 's calculator project.
After using so many resources and cobbling together a working calculator
    I found I didn't understand how it worked. So this is a fresh start
    with the intent of knowing it thoroughly enough I could explain and 
    possibly teach another how a calculator is made.
I have added additional functionality beyond the Extra Credit.
M+, M-, MR, MC, +/-, %, âˆš, power on and off. Adding keyboard functionality to these additional buttons was forgone.
